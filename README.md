# Marketing_Analysis

## Project Overview
Investigating Non-UK Conversions in UK Targeted Marketing Campaigns.

## Objectives:
The primary objective of this project is to analyze the dataset and determine the factors contributing to the increasing share of non-UK conversions in UK-targeted campaigns. This will involve comparing the performance of UK and non-UK conversions, understanding patterns across various dimensions such as platforms (iOS vs. Android), publishers, and fleet types, and using Germany as a reference market for benchmarking. The insights gained will help inform whether adjustments are needed in the geo-targeting setup or other aspects of the campaign strategy.

## Data Sources
The provided dataset aggregates data from passengers converted through digital marketing campaigns in both the UK and Germany. The key dimensions include:

- Publisher: Identifying which publisher the campaign belongs to.
- Mobility Type: Type of fleet used (e.g., Private Hire).
- Conversion Country: The country where the conversion occurred.
- Country Code by Phone: The country code of the user based on their phone.
- Asset Country: The country where the campaign was targeted (expected to be the UK).
- Platform: The platform on which the conversion occurred (iOS or Android).
- Duration Install to Activation: The time between app install and activation.
- Conversions: The number of conversions.
- Month: Time period of the campaign.

 

## Exploratory Data Analysis

## Trend Analysis

### _1) Showcase the UK/Non-UK conversion trend from targeted UK campaigns._
   - Why do I want to know?
      - Understanding the conversion trends over time for UK vs. non-UK markets is key since the campaign targets only UK users. However, we're seeing a growing number of conversions from non-UK countries, which could indicate potential issues. By comparing conversion trend MoM, I can identify if it's seasonality or a long-standing issue. This will help focus on potential root causes more effectively.
   - So what?
      - If non-UK conversions are growing disproportionately, it suggests a failure in geo-targeting, which can have significant implications:
           - **Budget Inefficiency:** Marketing spend intended for UK users is being wasted on non-UK conversions, reducing overall ROI.
           - **Geo-Targeting Accuracy:** If geo-targeting is malfunctioning or misconfigured, it affects the campaign's ability to reach its intended audience. This could lead to lower conversions from UK-based users.
           - **Cross-Border Opportunities:** If the non-UK conversions reflect actual user interest, this could present an opportunity to expand campaigns beyond the UK, potentially opening new markets. However, it would require deliberate strategy adjustments rather than unintended spillover.
       
In oder to find out the potential factors for non-UK conversion increase, this analysis will dive into **_Geo-Targeting Accuracy_** and **_Cross-Border Traffic._**


```ruby
-- UK vs. Non-UK conversion Trend Overview
SELECT 
    month,
    SUM(CASE WHEN conversion_country = 'UK' THEN conversions ELSE 0 END) AS UK_Conversions,
    SUM(CASE WHEN conversion_country = 'UK' THEN conversions ELSE 0 END) / SUM(conversions) AS UK_Conversion_Share,
    SUM(CASE WHEN conversion_country != 'UK' THEN conversions ELSE 0 END) AS Non_UK_Conversions,
    SUM(CASE WHEN conversion_country != 'UK' THEN conversions ELSE 0 END) / SUM(conversions) AS Non_UK_Conversion_Share
FROM 'campaigns.csv'
WHERE asset_country = 'UK'
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month ASC;
```

### **Findings -  Trend Analysis**
- **UK conversion decline:** UK conversions dropped from 83.5% in January 2022 to just 28.2% by September 2023, indicating a sharp decline in UK-based conversions over time.
- **Non-UK conversion growth:** Non-UK conversions increased steadily, growing from 16.5% in January 2022 to 71.8% by September 2023, highlighting a significant shift in audience location.

As non-UK conversions increased, UK conversions decreased in proportion, suggesting potential cannibalization. 




### _2)  Evaluate the performance of geo-targeting from the publishers.
- Why Do I Want to Know?
    - I want to see if specific publishers are causing conversions outside the target market, which could indicate geo-targeting issues.

- So What?
    - If certain publishers are off-target, it means wasted ad spend. Identifying them lets us fix the issue or reallocate budget to improve campaign performance.

By comparing the **_country_code_by_phone_** (the user's phone number country) with the **_conversion_country_** (where the conversion occurred) and **_asset_country_** (marketing targeted country - in this case it's uk), It allows you to detect if there is any mismatches between usersâ€™ phone numbers and the conversion location, highlighting potential geo-targeting inefficiencies.

```ruby
-- how mismatches look like from publisher
SELECT 
    publisher,
    
    -- UK Campaigns
    SUM(CASE WHEN asset_country = 'UK' AND conversion_country = 'UK' THEN conversions ELSE 0 END) AS UK_Conversions,
    SUM(CASE WHEN asset_country = 'UK' AND conversion_country != 'UK' THEN conversions ELSE 0 END) AS Non_UK_Conversions,
    
    -- Mismatches for UK 
    SUM(CASE WHEN asset_country = 'UK' AND conversion_country != country_code_by_phone THEN conversions ELSE 0 END) AS UK_Mismatched_Conversions,
    CONCAT(ROUND(
        SUM(CASE WHEN asset_country = 'UK' AND conversion_country != country_code_by_phone THEN conversions ELSE 0 END) /
        SUM(CASE WHEN asset_country = 'UK' THEN conversions ELSE 0 END) * 100, 2), '%') AS UK_Mismatched_Conversion_Rate,

    -- DE Campaigns
    SUM(CASE WHEN asset_country = 'DE' AND conversion_country = 'DE' THEN conversions ELSE 0 END) AS DE_Conversions,
    SUM(CASE WHEN asset_country = 'DE' AND conversion_country != 'DE' THEN conversions ELSE 0 END) AS Non_DE_Conversions,

    --Mismatches for DE 
    SUM(CASE WHEN asset_country = 'DE' AND conversion_country != country_code_by_phone THEN conversions ELSE 0 END) AS DE_Mismatched_Conversions,
    CONCAT(ROUND(
        SUM(CASE WHEN asset_country = 'DE' AND conversion_country != country_code_by_phone THEN conversions ELSE 0 END) /
        SUM(CASE WHEN asset_country = 'DE' THEN conversions ELSE 0 END) * 100, 2), '%') AS DE_Mismatched_Conversion_Rate

FROM 'campaigns.csv'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY UK_Mismatched_Conversions DESC, DE_Mismatched_Conversions DESC;
```

### **Findings - Geo-Targeting Accuracy**
- **Higher UK Mismatches:** UK has consistently higher mismatched conversion rates than DE. For example, PublisherS has a 58.5% UK mismatch vs. 28.4% in DE, and PublisherT shows 59.9% in the UK vs. 43.6% in DE.
- **DE Performs Better:** DE generally shows lower mismatched rates. PublisherK has 57.5% UK mismatches but only 42.5% in DE

### **Recommendations:**
- Focus on urgent publishers with the highest mismatch rates to refine targeting strategies.


### _3) Evaluate the conversion performance breakdown by the attribution type for UK and DE._
- Why Do I Want to Know?
    - I want to see conversion performance in each attribution type, which could indicate geo-targeting issues.

- So What?
    - If certain attribution_type are off-target, it means wasted ad spend. Identifying them lets us fix the issue or reallocate the budget to improve campaign performance.

### **Findings:**
- **UK Conversions:**
    - Install: 51.79% of conversions come from UK users, while 48.21% are non-UK, indicating that we need to require a better review for better geo-targeting.
    - Retargeting: Strong UK focus with 72.42% of conversions.
    - Reattribution: 88.40% of UK conversions highlight successful win-back efforts.



- **DE Conversions:**
    -  Install: 80.56% of conversions are local, showing highly effective acquisition campaigns.
    -  Retargeting: 90.54% of conversions come from within Germany, indicating strong re-engagement.




## Traffic Source Analysis
### _4) Demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of traffic sources by analyzing nonbrand Gsearch sessions and orders split by device type._
   - Why do I want to know?
      - Understanding nonbrand Gsearch sessions by device type is essential for optimizing user experience and targeting marketing efforts effectively.
   - So what?
      - Analyzing this data enables strategic decision-making, leading to improved user engagement and conversion rates through device-specific optimization and targeted marketing strategies.
   - Measured by?
        - website_session // device_type // order_id

![Sessions by Device Types](https://github.com/fangoaish/SQL__eCommerce-Analysis-for-Maven-Fuzzy-Factory/assets/51399519/ff4882ea-9719-423c-9f1c-ac03760a6c77)

![Orders by Device Types](https://github.com/fangoaish/SQL__eCommerce-Analysis-for-Maven-Fuzzy-Factory/assets/51399519/9628b4bc-3051-42c7-9234-cff0a7d33bcd)

![Conversion Rates Between Desktop and Mobile](https://github.com/fangoaish/SQL__eCommerce-Analysis-for-Maven-Fuzzy-Factory/assets/51399519/0bca869d-e4f7-4aa8-ba6c-246207f393b7)


- **Desktop vs. Mobile Sessions**: There is a clear trend of increasing sessions on both desktop and mobile devices over the months, with desktop sessions consistently higher than mobile sessions.

- **Desktop vs. Mobile Orders**: Similarly, desktop orders outpace mobile orders, indicating that desktop users are more likely to make purchases compared to mobile users.

- **Conversion Rates**: While desktop conversion rates remain relatively stable at around 4-5%, mobile conversion rates fluctuate, with some months showing significantly lower rates.

- **Conclusion**: Desktop devices dominate both sessions and orders, suggesting that desktop users are the primary drivers of traffic and conversions. However, it's essential to address the lower conversion rates on mobile devices to capitalize fully on this traffic source. Strategies aimed at optimizing the mobile user experience and improving mobile conversion rates should be prioritized to ensure a comprehensive understanding and effective utilization of traffic sources across different devices


## Website Performance Monitoring Analysis
### _5) Monitor and improve website performance by tracking session-to-order conversion rates monthly over the first 8 months._
   - Why do I want to know?
      - to understand and optimize each step of your user's experience on their journey toward purchasing your products
      - look at each step in the conversion flow to see how many customers drop off and how many continue on at each step
   - So What?
      - identify the most common paths customers take before purchasing your products
      - identify how many of your users continue on to each next step in your conversion flow, and how many users abandon at each step
      - optimize critical pain points where users are abandoning, so that you can convert more users and sell more products
   - Measured by?
      - we will create temporary tables using pageview data in order to build our multi-step funnels
      - We will first identify the sessions we care about, then bring in the relevant pageviews, then flag each session as having made it to certain funnel steps, and finally perform a summary analysis

<img width="510" alt="eCommerce Q5" src="https://github.com/fangoaish/SQL__eCommerce-Analysis-for-Maven-Fuzzy-Factory/assets/51399519/5d473d87-c48e-44e6-bf7d-a98ab0f5ee59">

## Conversion Funnel Analysis
### _6) Monitor and improve website performance by tracking session-to-order conversion rates monthly over the first 8 months._
Before diving into the data directly, let's list out the analysis process
- **STEP 0**: Have an overview of the conversion funnel path
   - Conversion funnel path:
      - /home ; /lander-1
      - /products
      - /the-original-mr-fuzzy
      - /cart
      - /shipping
      - /billing
      - /thank-you-for-your-order
<img width="173" alt="eCommerce Q7" src="https://github.com/fangoaish/SQL__eCommerce-Analysis-for-Maven-Fuzzy-Factory/assets/51399519/1b54b1a5-3f32-476e-9b24-60057c90bdd1">

- **STEP 1**: Identify each relevant pageview for relevant sessions as the specific funnel step
- **STEP 2**: Create the session-level conversion funnel view
- **STEP 3**: Aggregate the data to assess funnel performance

   
   - Session Funnels
<img width="695" alt="eCommerce Q7-1" src="https://github.com/fangoaish/SQL__eCommerce-Analysis-for-Maven-Fuzzy-Factory/assets/51399519/9ba4cf9c-4a5f-4fc1-821d-89b8fec6c5ea">

   - Click Through Rate Funnels
<img width="745" alt="eCommerce Q7-2" src="https://github.com/fangoaish/SQL__eCommerce-Analysis-for-Maven-Fuzzy-Factory/assets/51399519/f6073b36-3191-4eb8-aa90-9ba675f1f020">

The custom lander page has better click-through rates than the original homepage.


## Revenue Analysis
### _7) Estimate the revenue generated from the search lander test by analyzing the increase in conversion rates and subsequent revenue._
   - Why do I want to know?
      - to understand the performance of the key landing pages and then test to improve the results
   - So what?
      - Identifying the top opportunities for landing pages - high volume pages with higher than expected bounce rates or low conversion rates
      - Setting up A/B experiments on your live traffic to see if we can improve our bounce rates and conversion rates
      - Analyzing test results and making recommendations on which version of landing pages we should use forward
   - Measure by?
      - To analyze landing page performance and compare multiple pages, we will again use temporary tables and write a multi-step 'data program'
      - We will find the first pageview for relevant sessions, associate that pageview with the URL seen, and then analyze whether that session had additional pageviews

Before diving into the data directly, let's list out the analysis process
- **STEP 0**: Find out when the new page /lander launched
    - The first_test_pageview ID is **23504** and was created at 2012-06-19 00:35:54
<img width="237" alt="eCommerce Q6" src="https://github.com/fangoaish/SQL__eCommerce-Analysis-for-Maven-Fuzzy-Factory/assets/51399519/6d1248a6-5ec0-41f8-a2ba-5ea4da4e2d29">

- **STEP 1**: Find the first first_seen_landing_page_id for relevant sessions

- **STEP 2**: Identify the landing page of these relevant sessions
  
- **STEP 3**: Make a table to bring in the orders
  
- **STEP 4**: Find the difference between conversion rates
    - The conversion rate for **_/lander-1_** was higher at 4.06% compared to 3.18% for **_/home_**.
    - Therefore, **_/lander-1_** appears to be the more effective landing page in terms of driving conversions.
<img width="391" alt="eCommerce Q6 -1" src="https://github.com/fangoaish/SQL__eCommerce-Analysis-for-Maven-Fuzzy-Factory/assets/51399519/8f504175-3481-4a6d-8c21-6cf685fd5269">

- **STEP 5**: Find out the last time when the traffic was sent to **_/home_**
    - To estimate the revenue generated by the new test lander page, we first identify the most recent appearance of the **_/home_** page. Subsequently, we calculate the total number of sessions since that occurrence.
    - The latest website_session_id is **17145**
    - After this session, the /home landing page is discontinued, and all landing pages are replaced with **_/lander-1_**.
<img width="259" alt="eCommerce Q6 -2" src="https://github.com/fangoaish/SQL__eCommerce-Analysis-for-Maven-Fuzzy-Factory/assets/51399519/dca8d754-6f6c-4b5a-99a0-0d73c235b0f1">


- **STEP 6**: Count the total sessions after the last time **_/home_** page to estimate the revenue
<img width="143" alt="eCommerce Q6 -3" src="https://github.com/fangoaish/SQL__eCommerce-Analysis-for-Maven-Fuzzy-Factory/assets/51399519/bafabab1-258a-49b8-ae1e-c075903c8632">


- **STEP 7**: Calculate Average Revenue
    - 22,972 total website sessions for **_/lander-1_**
    - Conversion rate difference: 0.88%
    - 22,972 * 0.88% incremental conversion = 202 -> incremental orders since July 29th (roughly 4 months)
    - 202/4 = roughly 50 extra orders per month, not bad!

## Product Analysis
### _9) Evaluate the impact of introducing new products by tracking monthly sessions to the /products page and changes in click-through rates, along with improvements in conversion rates from /products to placing orders._
   - Why do I want to know?
      - to learn how customers interact with each of our products, and how well each product converts customers
   - So what?
      - Understand which of our products generate the most interest on multi-product showcase pages
      - Analyzing the impact on website conversion rates when we add a new product
      - Build product-specific conversion funnels to understand whether certain products convert better than others
   - Measured by?
      - We'll use website_pageviews data to identify users who viewed the /product page and see which products they clicked next
      - From specific product pages, we will look at view-to-order conversion rates and create multi-step conversion funnels

<img width="853" alt="eCommerce Q9" src="https://github.com/fangoaish/SQL__eCommerce-Analysis-for-Maven-Fuzzy-Factory/assets/51399519/7118db23-6031-4f8b-bd7c-0987c9e17353">

![_products Page Performance Between 2012 and 2014](https://github.com/fangoaish/SQL__eCommerce-Analysis-for-Maven-Fuzzy-Factory/assets/51399519/1b9e19de-b9f3-4129-bf56-ed2b68eb493b)


- The introduction of new products has positively impacted user engagement and conversion rates on the /products page. 
- Over the years, we've seen significant increases in monthly sessions and click-through rates, indicating heightened user interest. Additionally, the conversion rates from /products to orders have consistently improved, reflecting the positive influence of new products on driving sales and revenue growth. 


### _10) Elevate the fourth product from a cross-sell item to a primary offering._
Could you please pull sales data since then, and show how well each product cross-sells from one another?_
   - Why do I want to know?
      - to understand which products users are most likely to purchase together, and offer smart product recommendations
      - Using this data, we can develop a deeper understanding of our customer purchase behaviors
   - So what?
      - understand which products are often purchased together
      - Test and optimize the way we cross-sell products on our website
      - understand the conversion rate impact and the overall revenue impact of trying to cross-sell additional products
   - Measured by?
      - We can analyze orders and order_items data to understand which products cross-sell and analyze the impact on revenue
      - We'll also use website_pageviews data to understand if cross-selling hurts overall conversion rates

<img width="937" alt="eCommerce Q10" src="https://github.com/fangoaish/SQL__eCommerce-Analysis-for-Maven-Fuzzy-Factory/assets/51399519/3a58ee22-f250-493d-9d9f-6a59a932894e">

For Product 4, which shows potential cross-selling opportunities with other products but has the lowest total orders among the primary products, the following actions could be considered:
   - **Promotional Bundles**: Offer bundled deals combining Products 4 with other products to incentivize customers to purchase all items together, thereby increasing the likelihood of cross-sales.
   - **Enhanced Product Placement**: Strategically place Product 4 alongside other products on the website or in-store displays to encourage customers to explore and consider purchasing all items as a set.
